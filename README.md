# Description  
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.  

# Objective  
The main objective of this project is to build a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools and to identify the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning techniques  

# Getting Started  
The data and required python libraries are mentioned in the notebook boston_housing_v1.py
